    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, training data plays a crucial role in training algorithms or models to accurately predict specific outcomes or answers. When it comes to wetland classification, ensuring that the training dataset includes a diverse representation of different wetland types is essential. This is where stratified random sampling comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stratified random sampling is a method that takes into account the variations and diversity within wetland areas. By stratifying the sampling process, the aim is to ensure that each wetland type, such as marshes, swamps, or bogs, is proportionately included in the generated samples. This approach is important because it helps to capture the distinct characteristics and patterns associated with each wetland type.\n",
    "\n",
    "By including representative samples from various wetland types, the resulting wetland classification model becomes more robust and accurate in identifying and classifying different wetland categories. It enables the model to learn and understand the specific features, such as vegetation composition, hydrological characteristics, or soil properties, that define each wetland type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the balanced representation of wetland types in the training dataset helps to mitigate the risk of biases or disproportionate emphasis on certain wetland categories. This ensures a more comprehensive understanding of the overall wetland ecosystem and enhances the model's ability to generalize its classification predictions to unseen data."

    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to generate samples for training a wetland classification model. The notebook focuses on creating representative samples of both wetland and non-wetland areas in order to train an accurate and robust model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps outline the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the study area and wetland inventory vectors:** In this step, the study area boundaries and the vector data representing wetland locations are loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sample wetland and non-wetland areas:** The notebook employs a sampling strategy based on the specific scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. **Sampling with wetland types:** If there are multiple wetland types present, the notebook utilizes stratified random sampling. This approach\n",
    "    proportionately includes samples from each wetland type, capturing the variations and diversity within wetland areas. By considering the\n",
    "    distinct characteristics of each wetland type, the wetland classification model can accurately classify different wetland categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. **Sampling without wetland types:** When there is only one wetland type or no wetland types present, random sampling is used. This\n",
    "    sampling approach ensures a balanced spatial distribution across the study area.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. **Non-Wetland area:** For non-wetland areas, random sampling is utilised to ensure a balanced spatial distribution across the study area.This means that samples are randomly selected from the available non-wetland areas, taking into account the proportion of non-wetland areas to the total study area. The purpose of this sampling approach is to capture the spatial patterns and characteristics specific to the non-wetland class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create Combine the wetland and non-wetland samples:** The wetland and non-wetland samples generated from the previous step are combined into a single dataset. This combined dataset will be used for training the wetland classification model. By including both wetland and non-wetland samples, the model can learn to distinguish and classify different types of wetlands accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, the notebook creates a comprehensive and balanced training dataset for the wetland classification model, enabling it to accurately identify and classify wetland areas based on their distinct characteristics."

The goal is to capture the overall characteristics and patterns exhibited by wetland areas, without considering the differentiation between specific wetland types."

    "### Sampling with wetland types\n",
    "This code samples points within polygons based on a wetland inventory GeoDataFrame. It starts by defining the total number of points to sample. The wetland polygons are then grouped by class, which means that polygons with the same wetland class are grouped together. To ensure a proportional sampling approach, the code calculates the total area of each wetland class by summing the areas of the polygons within each class. This information is then used to determine the proportion of the total area that each wetland class represents. An empty list is created to store the sampled points. The code proceeds to sample points from each wetland class based on the proportion of the total area it represents. It does this by randomly selecting a polygon from each class and then sampling a random point within the bounding box of that polygon. The code checks if the sampled point falls within the selected polygon. If it does, the point is added to the list of sampled points. This process continues until the desired number of points for each wetland class is reached. In cases where there are more points sampled than desired, the code removes the excess points to match the specified total number of points. Conversely, if there are not enough points sampled, the code randomly samples points from all polygons until the desired number is reached."

    "### Class balancing \n",
    "A challenge encountered during the labeling of training data is class imbalance, which refers to the uneven distribution of classes within the dataset. During model training, the algorithm aims to optimize its performance over all training data. Therefore, an imbalanced training dataset can lead to a biased model. For example, when faced with a minority class, the model is more likely to misclassify it as a majority class rather than the other way around. In some cases, the distribution of the training data is intentionally designed to mirror the true distribution of the classes, and the resulting predictions are expected to be biased against the infrequent class. Alternatively, accuracy requirements may differ for various classes, making it desirable to adjust the proportions of the training labels. This adjustment ensures that there are more training data points available for classes where commission error (false positive) is preferred over omission error (false negative)."
